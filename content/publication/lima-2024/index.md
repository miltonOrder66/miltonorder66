abstract: This study proposes a novel framework for assessing the maturity of adaptive
  cybersecurity measures to enhance overall cybersecurity resilience and mitigate
  related risks. The frameworkâ€™s validity was confirmed by developing and testing
  a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) in collaboration with cybersecurity experts from
  the power generation industry. Feedback from all experts affirmed that the framework
  effectively addresses the cybersecurity requirements and operational protocols inherent
  to the power generation sector.
